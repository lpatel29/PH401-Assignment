Inputs
Shape (Cuboctahedral/Spherical)
Application (Optical/Electrical/Magnetic/Strength/None)
Range of size of nanoparticle (default: 1-50 nm)
Output
Graph of % of atoms in Bulk/Surface vs. Particle Size for the chosen Shape and Application

Workflow
First, a user must choose one of the shapes (Cuboctahedral/Spherical). Then, the user can optionally choose one of the following applications. The nanoparticle sizes are mentioned below:

Application	Radius Range (nm)
Optical	40-100
Electrical	10-20
Magnetic	1-10
Strength	1-50
None	User Choice
If the user doesn't want to choose any of the applications among Optical, Electrical, Magnetic, Strength, they can just select None and type custom range values for nanoparticle size.

Finally, the user give input as index 1/2/3/4/5

Code
The Code uses the following formulae:

Total Number of atoms in Cuboctahedral shape = (10k^3 + 15k^2 + 11k + 3)/3

Number of atoms on the surface of Cuboctahedral shape = (10k^2 + 2)

Total Number of atoms in Spherical shape = (10k^3 - 15k^2 + 11k - 3)/3

Number of atoms on the surface of Spherical shape = (10k^2 - 20k + 12)

where, k is the size of the atom

After the user gives the inputs, the application will apply the appropriate formulae to calculate the % of surface atoms for the specified shape. Then, this value is subtracted from 100 to get the % of bulk atoms. These percentages are calculated for all particle sizes in the size range specified.

Finally, a graph is plotted with these percentages on the Y-axis and particle sizes on the X-axis.
